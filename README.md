Create a simple web application to display a summary of recent commits to GIT, as well as the ability to see detailed statistics on a particular application.  The information should be manageable directly through t a user interface, as well as calling the web application directly using APIS.  Using MERN (or MEAN) stack as a reference architecture, develop a web application with the following characteristics:

1. Connect to the Github API and display a summary of the most recent 25 commits in the nodejs repository.

2. If a commit hash ends in a number, color that entry light blue.

3. Provide the ability to "drill down" and see the details of the commit.

4. Provide login protection to your application.

5. Using a unit testing library of choice, verify that rows containing commit hashes ending in a number are colored light blue.

### TO RUN THE APPLICATION

npm install

npm start

and then go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the output
